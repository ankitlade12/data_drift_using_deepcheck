# Data Drift Detection uisng Deepchecks #

**Data Drift**

If there is changes in the data, we normally call it as Data Drift or Data Shift. A Data Drift can also refer to

* Changes in the input data.
* Changes in the values of the features used to define or predict a target label.
* Changes in the properties of the independent variable.

**Model Drift**

This refers to changes in the performance of the model over time. It is the deterioration of models over time in the case of accuracy and prediction. ML Models do not live in a static environment hence they will deteriorate or decay over time.

**Deepchecks**

* Useful for detecting data drift,data integrity,model performance etc.
* !pip install deepchecks
